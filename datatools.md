##descriptive analaysis:
* describe the analysis
* census website is what's up
* just describing population

##exploratory analysis
* good for discovering new connections
* not good for predicting
* CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION

##inferential anylisis
###* use small amount to say somethin bout biggie
* common goal of statistical models
* includes estimating the quality
* does bad air kill babies?

##predictive analysis
###Use data on some objs to predict others
* X predicts why != X causes why
* depends on using the right variables
* best with more data and simple model
* TARGET FIGURED SOME TEEN WAS PREGZ WTF

##causal analysis
###how does changing one nut change the other nut?
* needs Randomizeroni
* GOLD STANDARD
* shows averages
* doodie donors make for better health

##mechanistic analysis
###understand the exact changes that change other variables in other objs
* hard to infer except when it's basic af
* deterministic tools used 
* can infer params from the equations

###Terms:
* population 
* variables
* qualitative vs quantitative vs quatto

###Data is the second most important thing, subsurvient to the QUESTION
* What is it? (epic)
* don't be driven by the fact you have data, be driven by the question

* more like a hadoodoop


##Exprimental Design in analysis
###Example case : we goofed on chemo
* care about the plan
* data and code sharing
* formulate your question in advance
ex. Can an AB test improve donations?
###Statistical inference
keys
* population
* probability
\/
* descriptive statistics
-----------
* Samples
* Inferential Statistics

ex.
Over 1k visitors, what's average donation?
* wide variance causes ambiguity
* clusters can say something but not a lot
* large difference between actual amount donated is more indicative (because it is a function of visitors not a direct output, so over a sample i dunno something something

##Confounding Variables
Try to correlate shoe size and literacy.
experiment sez small shoes = can't read.
age is the actual variable causing this relationship.
when you are young you can't read yo.
"Spurious correlation"
who is this guy, a cowboy?
##Avoiding Confouning
* make fixed variables
* stratify your variables, so usage is equal in both versions
* randomize (ALWAYS THE ANSWER)

NON RANDOM:
if you always provide some treatman range to samples based on a confoundin g variable. makes it hard to distinguins differnce is due to treament or the confouding variable

##Prediction inference difficulties
* you want to make predictions on a set of samples
* group responses into haves and have nots
* build predictive function to try to predict new samples response
* prediction is slightly more challenging than inference

ex. difference in mean value from 2 populations
if there is overlapping space in the reponse of the two groups it can be difficult to tell if a sample came from population a or b
* prediction metods wants distributtions to be more seperated

##Prediction Key Quantities
* true positive, false positive, false neegative, true negative
* sensitivity = Pr( ptest | pdis)
* specicitify = pr(ntest | ndis)
* positive predicitve value = pr(pdis | ptest)
* negative predicitve value = pr(ndis | ntest)
* accuracy = pr (correct)

##Fudge Data Dredging
* DON'T GO DEEP ON BIG DATA
